/**
 * A jittered regular grid, read as a local proximity graph: `dist(i,j) <
 * radius` draws an edge, trimmed to run rim-to-rim between the two dots
 * (not centre-to-centre — see "Edges" below). There is no algebraic theorem
 * forcing order here (no Farris congruence, no divergence-free curl) — the
 * order is compositional. Rows and columns come from a plain lattice, and
 * jitter only perturbs it; it never scrambles it — `jitter` defaults to a
 * tenth of the cell, small enough that rows and columns stay unmistakable
 * at a glance. `radius` sits a little under the cell spacing, so most — not
 * all — points stay unconnected: at defaults roughly 30% of dots carry at
 * least one edge (measured in nodegarden.test.ts), mostly pairs with the
 * occasional 3+-dot chain where the local search catches more than one
 * neighbour. The sparseness is directional, not absolute: it is still MOST
 * dots unconnected, but the connected minority is meant to be plainly
 * visible, not a rare accident. This is what keeps it distinct from
 * `delaunay`, whose global triangulation connects every point by
 * construction — nodegarden's graph stays local and majority-empty (see the
 * "overlap defence" note in the spike report for the param corner where the
 * two converge).
 *
 * Placement — dots never overlap, by construction, not by luck: point
 * (i, j) sits at its lattice position, offset by a seeded jitter draw
 * (`jitter` of the cell, per axis) combined with a phase-driven fbm
 * displacement — the "drift" field, sampled at the plain lattice
 * coordinate. The drift read-point orbits a fixed circle in noise space
 * once per cycle, `(x + ρcos2πph, y + ρsin2πph)` (spec formula, §
 * "nodegarden — proximity graph"): value noise has no period of its own
 * (makeNoise2D hashes absolute lattice cells), so a closed orbit is the
 * only path that returns the noise read to where it started. `ph = phase %
 * 1`, and cos/sin are themselves exactly 1-periodic, so phase 0 and phase 1
 * sample the identical point — the loop closes byte-for-byte with no
 * special-casing. The combined (jitter + drift) offset vector is then
 * clamped in magnitude to `maxDisp` — computed fresh from the current
 * `cell`/`dotSize` so it holds for every param combination, not just the
 * shipped defaults — which guarantees the worst case (two axis-adjacent
 * points displaced straight at each other) still clears both dot radii plus
 * a `MIN_GAP_FRAC` (8%) sliver of `cell` as dark air. This is a hard,
 * tested invariant (see "dots never overlap" in nodegarden.test.ts), not a
 * tuned coincidence — pushing jitter or drift to their param maximums
 * simply saturates the clamp rather than ever producing a touching pair.
 *
 * Edges — rim-to-rim, not centre-to-centre: a line drawn between two dot
 * *centres* spends `2·dotSize` of its length buried under the fills it
 * connects, which at these dot sizes was most of the stroke (a bug an
 * earlier version of this pattern shipped with — see the spike report's
 * revision history). Each endpoint is pulled in along the connecting unit
 * vector by `dotSize`, so the drawn segment is the actual dark-ground gap.
 * If that gap is under `MIN_DRAWABLE_GAP_PX`, no line is drawn at all — at
 * that distance the two dots already read as touching, and a few-pixel
 * stub would only look like a rendering glitch.
 *
 * Edge continuity: `edgeFade` blends between a hard cutoff (opacity pops
 * from 0 to 1 the instant `dist` crosses `radius` — this is the fizz risk:
 * a pair hovering near the boundary under drift flickers on/off every frame
 * it crosses) and a full linear fade starting at `dist = 0`. In between,
 * `fadeStart = radius·(1 − edgeFade)` marks where the ramp begins; opacity
 * is 1 below `fadeStart` and ramps linearly to exactly 0 at `dist = radius`
 * — continuous at the crossing for any `edgeFade > 0`, so raising it (not
 * retuning `radius` or `jitter`) is the fix for chatter. Default `edgeFade`
 * is deliberately low (0.03): the fade band is a thin margin right at the
 * boundary, so a typical connected pair renders at legible opacity — only
 * the pairs about to break (or that just formed) render faint. See
 * `tests/patterns/nodegarden.test.ts` for the measured births/deaths and
 * opacity-jump numbers this claim rests on.
