/**
 * Ribbon Interlace — a flat Celtic weave on a honeycomb.
 *
 * Every hexagonal face carries a closed hexagonal ribbon ring; every
 * honeycomb *vertex* (a hexagon corner, shared by three faces) carries a
 * Y-shaped tri-radiate strand whose three arms reach into the three rings
 * around it.
 *
 * The over/under alternation is free. The honeycomb graph is bipartite (the
 * graphene A/B sublattices), and with corners indexed k = 0..5 from the
 * lattice's own angular origin, the class of a corner is exactly `k % 2` —
 * consistently across all three faces that share it. (Concretely: the corner
 * at angle -90° of one face is the corner at +30° of one neighbour and at
 * +150° of the other; 0, 2, 4 — all even. The same holds for every corner.)
 * So the rule "ring passes over arm at even corners, arm over ring at odd
 * corners" reads over/under/over/under/over/under around every single ring,
 * globally consistent, with zero randomness and zero bookkeeping. Six being
 * even is exactly why the motif is a hexagon.
 *
 * Occlusion is Celtic gap-cutting rather than painting: whichever strand
 * goes under is *cut* either side of the crossing, so no two bands overlap
 * anywhere in the drawing and the ink/paper pairs may be emitted in any
 * order. Butt caps make the break read as the classic open-ended gap.
