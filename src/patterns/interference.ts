/**
 * Two-/three-source circular-wave interference on a bed of horizontal
 * lines: z(x, y) = Σ sin(kᵢ·dist((x, y), Sᵢ) + φᵢ), each line's vertex
 * displaced vertically by z·amplitude. With equal kᵢ, a single term's
 * level sets are circles about Sᵢ; the SUM's fringes — where the phase
 * difference k·(r₁ − r₂) crosses a multiple of 2π — sit exactly on the
 * hyperbola family with foci at the sources (Fermat's two-source
 * construction, the textbook double-slit pattern). That's forced by the
 * distance-field geometry, not tuned — this pattern's forced-order
 * commitment. The `sources` built below sit symmetrically about the
 * frame's vertical axis, which gives the SOURCE PLACEMENT mirror symmetry
 * unconditionally. The rendered field itself is exactly mirror-symmetric
 * only in the special case k₁ = k₂ and φ₁ = φ₂ (swapping the two sources
 * must leave the sum unchanged); at defaults `detune` ≠ 0 and the two
 * seeded φᵢ are independent draws, so both break exact bilateral symmetry
 * on purpose — the composition reads as *approximately* symmetric (the
 * dominant term is the symmetric geometry) while still varying with seed
 * in a way that a shared single phase draw could not (see `phi0` below).
 * `detune` breaks the equal-k premise: k₂/k₁ = 1 + detune, turning the
 * static hyperbolae into fringes that visibly drift as phase advances.
 *
 * Register: the default lands in the dramatic look (~100 lines, separation
 * far off-canvas, ~4 fringes across the frame, amplitude well over 10×
 * the row spacing) where the lines keep their horizontal identity — they
 * sweep in a few big S-curves, not rings — while displacement is large
 * enough that neighbouring lines cross deep and stay crossed over a real
 * stretch of x. Those sustained crossings are what braid into luminous,
 * silk-like ribbons under the translucent stroke, concentrated where the
 * sweeps converge; that's the entire point of the pattern. Dropping
 * `lines` and `amplitude` (keeping the same off-canvas geometry) reaches
 * a calmer, non-crossing register — still visibly two-source, just gentle;
 * neither corner is special-cased or clamped away.
 *
 * A first pass kept the sources within the frame (separation a few hundred
 * pixels) with a much higher frequency: that reads as a bullseye — closed
 * concentric rings around a visible centre, the lines losing their
 * horizontal identity into circular banding — which is the wrong register
 * (see the commit's deviations note). Pushing the sources off-canvas is
 * what removes the closed-ring topology; only then does raising the
 * amplitude relative to the row spacing turn "a few lines touch" into
 * "the whole frame reads as braided."
